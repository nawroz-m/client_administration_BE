## Getting Started

- Setting Up the Development Environment.
  Before you start, ensure that you have Go (Golang) installed on your machine. You can download and install Go from the official website: https://golang.org/dl/.

- Installing Dependencies.
  The Client Administration may have external dependencies that you need to install. These dependencies are typically managed using Go Modules.

        1- Navigate to the project's root directory using the terminal.

        2- Run the following command to install the project's dependencies:

  `go mod download`

  This will fetch and install all the required dependencies specified in the go.mod file.

- Starting the Application.
  After setting up the development environment and installing dependencies, you can now start the Client Administration application.

        1- Navigate to the project's root directory using the terminal.

        2- Run the following command to start the application:

  `go run main.go`

  This command will compile and run the main Go file of the application.

  You also need to add environment variable in `.env` file as the following snip.

        PORT=8080
        MONGODBURL="<MongoDB URL>"
        DATABASENAME="<Your Database Name >"
        SECRETKEY="<A Secret Key >"

  You can access the application by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost:8080 (replace 8080 with the actual port number if it's different).
